   - Deployment guides
   - Architecture diagrams

2. **User Documentation**
   - User manuals
   - Video tutorials
   - Help center articles
   - FAQ section 

### Recommendations
- Regularly run load tests to confirm the system’s ability to handle “10,000 concurrent users” and optimize indexing on “employee records” for major queries.
- Ensure all code referencing environment variables or secure tokens is validated for multi-factor compliance, especially for production builds.
- Expand the test suite (including e2e) around major concurrency push-points (e.g., shift assignments, user management) to guarantee 99.9% uptime. 

#### AI and Forecasting
- If an AI-based scheduling or staff assignment module is implemented, the system must handle predictive algorithms in near real-time, processing multiple variables (employee skills, availability, department needs).  
- The AI/ML models must be tested for accuracy (≥ 85% correct shift recommendations) and performance (responding < 2 seconds under typical load).  
- Logging and transparency of AI decisions must be provided to meet compliance and auditing standards, especially for fairness in scheduling.
