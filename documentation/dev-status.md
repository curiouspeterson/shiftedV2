# Development Status

## Current State
- Successfully resolved build issues and stabilized the development environment
- Migrated to Node.js LTS (18.20.5) for improved stability
- Fixed type definitions and module imports across the codebase
- Implemented proper error handling in Supabase service role authentication
- Added comprehensive shift requirement management with CRUD operations

## Technical Debt & Improvements
- Package versions need to be standardized:
  - Currently using Next.js 13.4.19, consider upgrading to Next.js 14
  - Radix UI components are on mixed versions (1.0.x - 2.0.x)
  - Some dependencies have security vulnerabilities that need addressing
- TypeScript type definitions need further refinement:
  - Added missing type definitions for shift requirements
  - Need to ensure consistent type usage across components
- Environment variable handling needs improvement:
  - Added proper service role key validation
  - Consider implementing environment variable validation at startup

## Analysis & Next Steps
- The codebase currently uses Next.js 13.4.19. A planned upgrade to Next.js 14 should be scheduled and documented.
- Regularly update documentation to reflect completed tasks and technical decisions.
- Consider implementing automated tests for critical business logic.

### Looking Ahead
- Schedule upgrade to Next.js 14 and associated dependencies
- Implement comprehensive test suite for shift management features
- Address security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Enhance error handling and user feedback mechanisms
- Implement automated schedule generation with AI/ML capabilities
- Add real-time updates for schedule changes
- Develop advanced analytics dashboard for workforce insights

### Security & Performance
- Supabase integration is properly configured with role-based access
- Environment variables are properly handled and validated
- Consider implementing rate limiting for API routes
- Add monitoring for performance bottlenecks
- Implement proper error boundaries for production resilience

### Documentation Needs
- Update API documentation for new shift management endpoints
- Create user guides for schedule management features
- Document deployment procedures and environment setup
- Maintain changelog for version tracking
