Key Observations & Good Practices
	•	App Router Setup: The app/ directory takes full advantage of Next.js 13+ App Router. Routes like app/dashboard/schedule/page.tsx or app/dashboard/employees/[id]/availability/page.tsx illustrate the nested routing structure.
	•	Feature-Oriented Directories: Each main feature (e.g., employees, availability, shifts, etc.) has its own subdirectory. This promotes domain-based organization.
	•	Shared Components: The components/ folder is further subdivided into specialized areas (e.g., components/schedule, components/ui). Common UI primitives (buttons, inputs, etc.) live under components/ui/, consistent with Shadcn UI patterns.

1.2 Documentation

The documentation/ folder provides extensive markdown files covering:
	•	features.md
	•	implementation.md
	•	project-overview.md
	•	project-structure.md
	•	requirements.md
	•	tech-stack.md
	•	user-flow.md

They collectively serve as a mini knowledge base and are clearly aligned with best practices (architecture, user flows, requirements, etc.). This level of documentation is excellent for onboarding new developers or referencing detailed requirements.

2. Key App Directories & Features

2.1 app/ Directory
	1.	Root Layout & Global Styles
	•	app/layout.tsx sets up the HTML structure (e.g., <Toaster /> usage) and imports the main globals.css.
	•	app/globals.css imports Tailwind’s base, components, and utilities layers, plus custom CSS variables for light/dark theming.
	2.	Authentication Flows
	•	app/auth/callback/route.ts handles OAuth callbacks via Supabase SSR client.
	•	app/auth/verify/page.tsx is a simple page telling the user to check their email for a verification link.
	•	app/login/page.tsx and app/signup/page.tsx implement standard username/password flows (signIn / signUp from /lib/auth.ts).
	3.	Middleware
	•	middleware.ts sets up a custom server client to intercept requests. It checks if a user session exists before allowing access to /dashboard/* routes. If not, it redirects to /login. This approach ensures SSR-based session checks in Next.js 13.
	4.	Dashboard & Sub-Routes
	•	app/dashboard/layout.tsx:
	•	Uses a client component that checks if a user is authenticated (by calling supabase.auth.getUser()).
	•	Renders a <Sidebar /> and the main content.
	•	app/dashboard/*/page.tsx files:
	•	employees: Lists employees, includes EmployeesList and forms to add/edit employees.
	•	availability: Allows employees to manage their own weekly availability.
	•	schedule: Displays weekly schedule, includes a schedule generator.
	•	shifts: Manages recurring shift requirements.
	•	time-off: Request form and listing for personal time-off.
	5.	API Handlers
	•	app/api/employees/route.ts: A route handler supporting POST for create/update/delete operations.
	•	app/api/schedule/generate/route.ts: Example of a route handler to generate a weekly schedule from shift requirements and employee availability. The logic is quite robust, factoring in weekly hour limits, day-of-week constraints, etc.

2.2 components/ Directory
	1.	UI Components (components/ui)
	•	button.tsx, dialog.tsx, input.tsx, label.tsx, card.tsx, etc.`
	•	These are Shadcn/Radix UI-based primitives. They are well-structured, strongly typed, and consistent with Tailwind utility classes.
	2.	Domain-Specific Components
	•	add-employee-form.tsx: Creates a new user in Supabase Auth and a profiles row.
	•	employee-availability-manager.tsx: Allows managers to modify a selected employee’s availability.
	•	employee-schedule-manager.tsx: For editing an individual employee’s scheduled shifts.
	•	schedule/weekly-schedule.tsx: Renders a grid of days, shift requirements, and assigned employees.
	•	time-off-request-form.tsx & time-off-requests-list.tsx: Handle time-off request creation and listing.
	3.	Loading Components
	•	Each route has an optional loading.tsx fallback (e.g., app/dashboard/schedule/loading.tsx) that uses the Loading component from components/loading.tsx. This is a straightforward spinner-based UI following Next.js 13’s best practice for loading states.

2.3 lib/ Directory & Supabase Integration
	•	/lib/supabase/client.ts and /lib/supabase/server.ts:
	•	Provide separate clients for client-side vs. server-side usage.
	•	createBrowserClient() for front-end code.
	•	createAdminClient() with service_role key for privileged server operations.
	•	/lib/auth.ts:
	•	Contains signUp and signIn helper functions that wrap supabase.auth.signUp / signInWithPassword.
	•	RLS (Row Level Security) Enforcement:
	•	The codebase references RLS in the migrations (particularly in /supabase/migrations/).
	•	The application code checks roles (manager, employee) to ensure only managers can create or update certain records.

2.4 Database Schema & Migrations

All database logic is handled through the supabase/ folder:
	1.	Migrations
	•	Files like 20240101000000_create_initial_schema.sql set up tables (profiles, employee_availability, shift_requirements, shift_assignments), triggers, RLS policies, etc.
	2.	Policy Evolution
	•	There are multiple migrations tweaking RLS policies. We see an initial set of policies, then polices to fix or refine them. This indicates iteration on how best to secure the data with Supabase’s row-level constraints.
	3.	Functions & Triggers
	•	Creating public.handle_new_user() to auto-insert a profiles row whenever a new auth.users row is created.
	•	update_profile_raw(...) stored procedure for updates with security definers.

2.5 Scripting & Automation
	•	scripts/confirm-users.ts and scripts/delete-users.ts:
	•	Show how you can manage or confirm users in a batch using the Supabase service role.
	•	dotenv is used to load environment variables.
	•	These are command-line utilities that you can run once or schedule in CI.
