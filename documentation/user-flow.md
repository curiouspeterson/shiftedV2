## Data Flow

### 1. Authentication Flow
```
User → Login Request → Auth Service → JWT Token → Protected Routes
   ↳ Email/Password
   ↳ OAuth Provider
   ↳ 2FA Verification
```

### 2. Employee Data Flow
```
Create/Update Request → Validation → Database → Audit Log
   ↳ Input Validation
   ↳ Permission Check
   ↳ Business Rule Validation
   ↳ Data Persistence
```

### 3. Reporting Flow
```
Report Request → Data Aggregation → Format → Delivery
   ↳ Data Collection
   ↳ Processing
   ↳ Generation
   ↳ Distribution
```

## System Interactions

### 1. Real-time Updates
- WebSocket connections for live data
- Push notifications for alerts
- Instant message delivery
- Live dashboard updates

### 2. Background Processes
- Automated report generation
- Email notifications
- Data backups
- System maintenance

### 3. External Integrations
- HR systems
- Payroll services
- Time tracking
- Document management

## Error Handling

### 1. User Errors
- Invalid input validation
- Permission denied messages
- Session timeout handling
- Conflict resolution

### 2. System Errors
- Network failure recovery
- Database error handling
- Service unavailable responses
- Fallback mechanisms

## Security Measures

### 1. Access Control
- Role-based permissions
- IP restrictions
- Session management
- Activity monitoring

### 2. Data Protection
- Encryption in transit
- Encryption at rest
- Secure file handling
- Privacy controls

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Data Loading
- Lazy loading
- Pagination
- Caching strategies
- Query optimization

### 2. User Experience
- Loading states
- Error feedback
- Success confirmations
- Progressive enhancement

### Additional Flow Considerations
- For “Employee Journey,” consider automatically highlighting scheduling conflicts or time-off requests. This can be integrated with the “EmployeeScheduleManager” logic already observed in the codebase.
- For “Administrator Journey,” real-time RLS synchronization ensures that any changes to access roles or employee profiles reflect immediately in queries. Confirm that official “Supabase Realtime” hooks or webhooks are used where relevant.
- Add more precise error boundaries for each step, especially in highly interactive flows (e.g., shift creation, assignment, or department changes) to handle partial failures elegantly.

#### Simulation Flow (Future Concept)
- Drawing inspiration from “mock interview” flows in the example docs, Shifted could offer a “mock scheduling” or “what-if” scenario environment:
  1. Manager inputs hypothetical shift changes or new departmental structures.  
  2. The system simulates results (e.g., coverage, overtime risk, training calls).  
  3. The manager reviews the outcome and finalizes changes or reverts.  
- This simulation layer would utilize real-time data, combining employee profile info, department constraints, and business rules to deliver quick feedback.
