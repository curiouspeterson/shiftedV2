# Features Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of all features in the Shifted application, including their functionality, edge cases, and business rules.

## Core Features

### Employee Management
- **CRUD Operations**
  - Create new employee profiles with validation
  - Read employee information with proper authorization
  - Update employee details with audit logging
  - Delete employees with proper safeguards
- **Edge Cases**
  - Handling duplicate email addresses
  - Managing incomplete profile information
  - Dealing with archived vs. deleted employees

### Authentication & Authorization
- **User Authentication**
  - Email/password authentication

  - Admin privileges
  - Employee access levels
  - Permission management

### Dashboard & Analytics
- **Employee Overview**
  - Real-time employee status
  - Department distribution
  - Role allocation
- **Performance Metrics**
  - Employee engagement tracking
  - Department efficiency metrics
  - Resource utilization stats

### Data Management
- **Data Validation**
  - Input sanitization
  - Format verification

- **Data Privacy**
  - GDPR compliance
  - Data encryption
  - Access logging

### Additional Observations
- Consider deeper integration of Row Level Security (RLS) policies with the “Employee Management” and “Data Management” features to ensure employees and managers have consistent, least-privilege access.
- For the “Dashboard & Analytics,” adding near real-time data retrieval with TanStack Query (React Query) and leveraging Next.js server components can reduce unnecessary client-side state.
- Expand “Role-Based Access Control” to differentiate between managerial levels (e.g., department manager vs. super admin) where needed.

### Potential AI-Driven Extensions
- Similar to “resume analysis” in the example docs, an AI-based Shifted extension might analyze individual employee skill sets to recommend cross-department shifts or training paths.  
- Extend the scheduling logic to include predictive staff allocation, factoring in employee performance metrics, predicted workload spikes, and real-time availability.  
- Borrowing from “mock interview” logic, managers could formally “simulate” staff training or departmental shifts, enabling advanced scenario-planning or role shifts before finalizing actual schedule changes.
