# Implementation Guide

This document outlines the development approach, coding standards, and technical guidelines for implementing the Shifted application.

## Development Approach

### Architecture
- **Next.js App Router**
  - Server-first approach with React Server Components
  - Client components only where necessary
  - API routes for server operations

### Code Organization
- Feature-based directory structure
- Shared components in root components directory
- Utility functions in lib directory
- Type definitions in types directory

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Strict type checking enabled
- Interface over type where possible
- Proper error handling with custom types
- Zod for runtime type validation

### React & Next.js
- Functional components only
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Server components by default
- Error boundaries for fault tolerance

### Database & API
- Supabase for database and authentication
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Prepared statements for queries
- API route handlers with proper validation

## Timeline Estimates

### Phase 1: Foundation (2 weeks)
- Project setup and configuration
- Authentication implementation
- Basic database schema

### Phase 2: Core Features (3 weeks)
- Employee management CRUD
- Dashboard implementation
- Access control system

### Phase 3: Enhancement (2 weeks)
- Analytics implementation
- Performance optimization
- Testing and documentation

## Technical Guidelines

### Performance
- Image optimization with Next.js Image
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Server-side rendering where applicable
- Efficient database queries

### Security
- Input validation on all forms
- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection
- Secure authentication flows

### Testing
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component tests
- E2E testing with Playwright
- API endpoint testing

### Deployment
- Vercel for hosting
- Supabase for database
- Environment variable management
- CI/CD pipeline setup 

### Refined Workflow & Practices
1. Integrate your Supabase migrations with a CI or CD pipeline step, ensuring migrations run automatically before each deployment on Vercel. This keeps schemas in sync with production.
2. Implement consistent environment-variable management across “scripts/” and “api/” routes to avoid confusion in local vs. production settings (especially important for service role keys).
3. Consider adopting a dedicated “services/” folder for orchestrating complex server routes (e.g., schedule generation in “app/api/schedule/generate/route.ts”) to keep code more modular. 

### Future AI & Advanced Features
- If adopting advanced logic (e.g., AI-based scheduling or skills matching), consider encapsulating this logic in a “services/ai” or “services/scheduling” folder, mirroring the approach in example docs (where specialized logic is placed in dedicated service classes or modules).
- For advanced user interactions, incorporate a “mock scenario” style feature (similar to mock interviews in the examples) to train or test departmental configurations prior to going live.
- Use specialized validations (e.g., Zod + custom business rules) if user input or schedule generation parameters become more complex.
