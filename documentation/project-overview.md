# Project Overview

## Vision Statement
Shifted is a modern employee management system designed to streamline workforce administration, enhance organizational efficiency, and provide valuable insights through data-driven analytics.

## Core Goals
1. **Simplify Employee Management**
   - Streamline employee data management
   - Automate administrative tasks
   - Reduce manual paperwork

2. **Enhance Data Security**
   - Implement robust access controls
   - Ensure data privacy compliance
   - Maintain secure audit trails

3. **Improve Organizational Efficiency**
   - Provide real-time analytics
   - Enable data-driven decision making
   - Streamline departmental operations

## Problem Statement
Traditional employee management systems often lack modern features, are difficult to use, and don't provide the insights needed for effective workforce management. Shifted addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Modern Interface**: Intuitive, responsive design that works across devices
- **Smart Analytics**: Real-time insights into workforce metrics
- **Secure Access**: Role-based access control with proper data protection
- **Scalable Solution**: Architecture that grows with your organization

## Target Users
1. **HR Administrators**
   - Managing employee records
   - Handling administrative tasks
   - Generating reports

2. **Department Managers**
   - Viewing team information
   - Accessing department analytics
   - Managing team members

3. **Employees**
   - Updating personal information
   - Viewing relevant data
   - Accessing necessary resources

## Key Differentiators
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant data synchronization
- **Customizable**: Flexible configuration options
- **API-First**: Robust API for system integration
- **Mobile-Ready**: Responsive design for all devices

## Success Metrics
1. **User Adoption**
   - Number of active users
   - User engagement metrics
   - Feature utilization rates

2. **System Performance**
   - Page load times
   - API response times
   - System uptime

3. **Business Impact**
   - Reduction in administrative time
   - Improved data accuracy
   - Enhanced decision-making capability 

## Extended Analysis
- The existing codebase effectively implements the “Modern Tech Stack” approach: Next.js (App Router), Supabase, and real-time data. This matches the “Real-time Updates” differentiator well.
- Expand documentation around how managers interact with the system operationally, connecting the “Core Goals” to day-to-day manager tasks.
- Enhance milestone tracking of “Success Metrics” with monitoring or analytics solutions (e.g., Vercel Analytics, Sentry) for ongoing performance checks. 

### Future Outlook
- Shifted could evolve to include advanced forecasting, such as AI-based shift rotations or staff development planning.  
- Emulate the “mock interview” approach by substituting scheduling conflicts or skill alignment modules, allowing managers to pre-test or simulate scheduling setups before final approval.
- Potential synergy exists in bridging employee skill data with real-time scheduling to drive dynamic, data-driven staff allocations that reduce overhead and enhance employee engagement.
